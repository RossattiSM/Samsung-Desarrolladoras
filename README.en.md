# Samsung Developers

Samsung Developers Women's Edition - AKA "Samsung Desarrolladoras" - is a program created by Samsung Spain in collaboration with Bejob. It was thought to shorten the existing gender gap in the technology area.

The program has already trained more than 4,100 women since its first edition with a program to motivate and interest women in STEM disciplines. This repository contains the projects and exercises I did in its 5th edition, from ```Sep/29/2022``` to ```Feb/19/2023.```.
